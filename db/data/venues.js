  description: 'The Ryan Gosling of pubs.. A local boozer. A heaven for foodies bored of the usual \'pub grub\' on offer everywhere else. A place to see some of the best live comedy. A venue offering drag, burlesque and other delights. A craft beer lovers paradise. A dog-friendly drinking hole. A cult classic. A crowd-pleaser. A party venue. A place for a quiet pint and a catch-up. Venue for the local Womens Institute meetings. Occassional art gallery. A slightly weird pub staffed by friendly staff, who are sometimes a bit silly and sarcastic too.',
